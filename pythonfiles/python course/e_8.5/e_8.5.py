# Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line.
# When you find a line that starts with 'From ' like the following line:
# From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
# You will parse the From line using split() and print out the second word in the line (i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message).
# Then print out a count at the end.
# Hint: make sure not to include the lines that start with 'From:'.
# Desired Output:
# stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
